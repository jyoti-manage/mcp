1. First see the stateful method and then see for the stateless method.
2. The difference between the two methods is that the session ID needed is for stateful communication for maintaining a long-live connection, but no session ID is needed for the stateless method of communication. Because for example, just for a sum_tool, we do not need the client to have a long live connection with the server, so we do not need to initialize a session and send a follow-up request with the notification.
3.  While in the python coding part, the client code remains the same for both stateless and stateful. In stateless transport, it will simple ignore the session id.
